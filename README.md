Movie Recommendation System 
This recommends movies based on content based recommendation System.
I have preprocessed the tmdb dataset of 5000 movies
removed stop words mereged dataframes into 1 tag 
I have done text vectorization 4086,4086
Bag of word is used
Similarity is checked on basis of cosine similarity
not used the eucledian distance formula as it does not works well for large dataset


Made a UI using pycharm code etitor 
I have used streamlit where movied are recommended 
we are tranferring the output of my recommendation system to the ut by sending it as a dictionary as pickle lib does not take pandas dataframe
